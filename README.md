## Desensitization Algorithm

### Project Description

We implemented data de-identification algorithms for a healthcare data platform with a primary focus on safeguarding sensitive patient data. The project involved developing various data de-identification algorithms using the Java programming language and tools/techniques like Apache Commons Lang 3. The algorithms we created include:

- **Hash De-identification**: Utilized Java encryption libraries for irreversible data hashing.
- **Masking De-identification**: Applied Java to hide or mask data portions, reducing sensitive information visibility.
- **Replacement De-identification**: Employed Java string manipulation to replace sensitive data with fictional values.
- **Transformation De-identification**: Implemented data transformation and obfuscation in Java to reduce data analyzability.
- **Encryption De-identification**: Leveraged Java encryption algorithms to secure data, allowing authorized decryption.
- **Bucketing De-identification**: Segmented data into different categories using Java, reducing data correlation.

The primary goal of this project was to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive patient data while facilitating effective data analysis within the healthcare data platform.For more detailed instructions and information about the desensitization algorithm, please refer to the [documentation](https://drggboy.github.io/Desensitization_algorithm/Desensitization_Algorithm.html).

### Opening the Existing Project in Eclipse

To open an existing project in Eclipse, follow these steps:
